What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You decide when to commmit the changes, Cons: Sometimes is desirable saving automatically changes in case you forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because every file in the project is correlationed with the other ones

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Viewing the messages at the commit moment and the differences between them

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know that you get back to the point in which you commited an error and fix them

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm a programmer, so I need to learn and use Git
